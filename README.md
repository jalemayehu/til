> Today I Learned

We are constantly learning new things everyday, this is a collection of things I've learned as a student of technology. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips. Inspired by [Jon Evan's repository](https://github.com/evansj/til)
